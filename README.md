de# first-MTG-card-workscrape-proejct
a personal project on webscraping MTG cards data and price thorough start city game website (wip)

hello, and welcome to my very first python project i made while learning python

made this for fun and because im a bit lazy to constantly check for card price when making a trade with the local player 
since we have to go through multiple process of having rate conversion and asking as price updated every few month or so
with new set release :p .

sure i could use the available tools in the app store but they dont have any currency exchange of locals


to use:
- have selenium python pkgs
- open the for test run.txt file and write the name of the mtg card you want.
- to be more specific with your card you can add the set name and number (found in bottom right corner of the card)
  along with enn or enf (enn =english non foil, enf = english foil)
-just run it in any ide that support python xb

any tips and tricks are highly appreciated



author note: planning to add opencv someday to enable live scanner function or mass scan my friend wishlist as i am go to supplier for ordering single 
             from sites such as the one im scraping from or cardkingdom  but i wanna play around with first for something else
             shits look fun AF, not only that kinda planning to add live FXrate for easy conversion to local currency.
